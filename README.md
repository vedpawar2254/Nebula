# Project Nebula ✨
The flagship open-source initiative of the Society for Astrophysics and Space Technology (SAST)

## Overview 
Project Nebula is envisioned to be a collaborative platform that blends innovation, learning, and real-world development. At its core, Nebula aims to empower SAST members—especially juniors—by immersing them in the world of open-source contribution and full-stack development.

The project begins with the development of the SAST website, gradually evolving into an ecosystem of interconnected modules. This includes backend systems, interactive robotics dashboards, and project-specific tools. Nebula is designed not only to build impactful digital solutions but also to nurture a culture of continuous learning and technical collaboration within the SAST community.

## Learning & Development Focus
To ensure every contributor is equipped to participate meaningfully, Project Nebula incorporates a strong educational component:

Workshops & Technical Lectures: A series of sessions focused on open-source development, Git/GitHub best practices, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, EJS, databases, etc.).

Guided Learning: These sessions will guide students from foundational concepts to advanced practices.

Hands-On Experience: Project Nebula serves as both a practical, hands-on development experience and an educational journey.

## Project Nebula Stands For:
🚀 Building scalable, impactful tools for the SAST ecosystem.
🌍 Encouraging open-source contributions among students.
🧠 Fostering technical growth through mentorship, workshops, and peer learning.
🤝 Creating a collaborative space where creativity meets code.
